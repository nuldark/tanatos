# How to Contribute

## [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

The tanatos project has a
[Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
to which all contributors must adhere.

See [details on Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Pull Requests

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch for each feature or improvement
3. Send a pull request from each feature branch to the **master** branch

It is very important to separate new features or improvements into separate feature branches, and to send a
pull request for each branch. This allows me to review and pull in new features or improvements individually.
